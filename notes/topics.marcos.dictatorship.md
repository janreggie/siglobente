The Marcos dictatorship was a period in Philippine history between September 23, 1972 (Proclamation 1081) and February 25, 1986 (EDSA Revolution).
This period is often characterized by killings of the poor and mass looting by the Marcoses and his allies.

Fifty years later, in 2022, his son Bongbong was elected president.
