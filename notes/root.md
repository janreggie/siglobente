This Dendron workspace serves as my personal notes
for events, themes, people, etc. in Filipinas during the 20th century,
from the US Military Government to the start of the Fifth Republic.

This is by no means exhaustive.
History is a fractal and the forest of knowledge runs deep.
This repository is a way for me to organize

## Contributing

You can suggest some articles/topics for me to read.
These are *my* notes, just in public.

Feel free to fork this repo to serve as *your* notes.
